Airbnb Schema (SQL DDL)
This document outlines the database schema for a system modeling core functionalities of a vacation rental platform (like Airbnb). The schema is defined using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) and is designed to be compatible with PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Key Features
UUID Primary Keys: All primary keys use the UUID data type for global uniqueness.

Strong Constraints: Includes NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints to ensure data integrity (e.g., email uniqueness, rating range 1âˆ’5, valid roles).

Referential Integrity: Foreign keys are defined with appropriate ON DELETE actions to manage related data cleanup.

Performance: Indexes are explicitly created on foreign key columns and the USER.email column for faster lookups.
